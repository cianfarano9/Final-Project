# Final-Project
For my final project, I created a site that would be a place for me to post examples of my work and skills outside of my original portfolio. Here I can post collaborations with other artists, writing, samples, and pieces like my visual argument that will showcase my skills in a gallery. My plan is for this to be a personal site but hopefully one that potential employers could look at as well.
